# Mifesto: Query Module
This is a micro-frontend module that provides the means to interact with RDF data in a federated ([Consolid](https://content.iospress.com/articles/semantic-web/sw233396)) multi-model. The current module queries the project for physical elements, using SPARQL. In this proof-of-concept, the variables that represent an element of interest are indicated with a tag "_â‚¬". This is a temporary solution - future versions will allow the user to indicate this via selection boxes. Using ConSolid Reference Collections, the Query Module will then query the project's "Reference Registries" for other representations of these elements (e.g. pictures, point clouds, semantics). These representations can then be loaded in other modules. The below image shows this interaction, based on the [Visualisation&Query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AECOstore/RESOURCES/main/configurations/viz_query.ttl) configuration.

## About Mifesto
Mifesto (Micro-Frontend Store) is an experimental framework for federation of micro-frontends. It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. Micro-frontend modules expose the following: 

* a manifest file that describes the module and its dependencies
* loadable code which may be injected into a "bundler" application

The bundler application is responsible for loading the micro-frontend modules and providing a framework for them to interact with each other. The bundler application is also responsible for providing an interface for the micro-frontend modules to render into. Mifesto modules may or may not be compatible with the [ConSolid ecosystem](https://content.iospress.com/articles/semantic-web/sw233396), or generally with AEC multi-models. To be useful for interacting with multi-models, a minimal functionality is required. This functionality is described in the [Mifesto documentation]().
